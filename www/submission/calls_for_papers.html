        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p class="text-left">The 13th IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (IEEE CASE 2017), sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS), will be held in Xi'an, China, Auguest 20 to 23, 2017. IEEE CASE is a flagship automation conference of the IEEE RAS and constitutes the primary forum for cross-industry and multi-disciplinary research in automation. Its goal is to provide a broad coverage and dissemination of foundational research in automation among researchers, academics, and practitioners.</p>
        <p class="text-left">The technical program of IEEE CASE 2017 will consist of tutorials/workshops, keynote/plenary speeches, automation forums, and oral presentations. Papers describing original work on abstractions, algorithms, theories, methodologies, and case studies are invited. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the conference proceedings, and submitted for inclusion into IEEEXplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing(A&amp;I) databases. IEEE CASE is an offspring of the journal <em>IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</em>. The journal will publish a Special CASE Issue of top-rated papers. <em>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</em> will also accept journal quality publications in conjunction to CASE 2017.</p>
        <p class="text-left">Regular papers and special session proposals and papers should be submitted online at the conference website at www.case2017.org. One new feature of CASE 2017 is that the authors of the papers published or accepted in and after 2016 by <em>IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</em> or <em>IEEE Transactions on Robotics</em> can request presentation of their papers at the conference in the newly organized "transaction paper sessions". General inquiries should be addressed via Email to the Program Chair, Prof. Qingshan JIA at jiaqs@mail.tsinghua. edu.cn. The best conference paper award, The best application paper award, and the best student paper award will be selected.</p>
